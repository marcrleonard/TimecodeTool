# TimecodeTool

`TimecodeTool` is a simple CLI tool that does a handful of handy functions:
- Validated timecode input
- Calculate the time between two timecodes in realtime, framecounts, and timecode time
- (Coming soon) Convert timecodes between different frame rates

## Building

To build the tool, simply run `go build -o TimecodeTool ./cmd/TimecodeTool/main.go` in the root directory of the project. This will create an executable named `main` in the root directory.
